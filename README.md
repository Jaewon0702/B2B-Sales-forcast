[LG Aimers](https://www.lgaimers.ai/) is an education program that works on machine learning projects with actual data at [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/).

# Project
- Title: Let's develop B2B sales forecast model with MQL Data   
- Period: 2024.01.02 - 02.26   
- Evaluation: F1 Score

# Skills
- Software: [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- Type: [Binary Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification)
- Model: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, GradientBoostingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier

# It's the data, stupid!
- Lesson: What I learnd from project is 'It's the data, stupid!'.
- Perfomance Improvement: When I did feature engineering, the F1 score increased by more than 25% in the test set.
- Feature Engineering: Changed the categorical data to probability
